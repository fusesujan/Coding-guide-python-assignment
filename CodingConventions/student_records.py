"""
Create a Python program that manages student records. The program should have the
following functionalities:
-Create a function that can add new students to the records with their student_id,
name, age, and grade. The records should be saved to “json” file and each time
new record is added, it should be saved to same “json” file
-Allow searching for a student by student_id or name. The data should return age
and grade from the saved file.
-Allow updating a student's information by using student_id or name(age or grade)
Ensure to follow PEP8 Coding Guidelines for following criterias:
- Proper Indentation
- Maximum Line Length
- Prescriptive Naming conventions (Package and Module Names, Class Names,
- Exception Names, Global Variable Names, Function and Variable Names, Method
- Names and Instance Variables, Constants)
- Source File Encoding while accessing the JSON file
- Add NumPy Docstring to each function
