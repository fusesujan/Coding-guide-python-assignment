''''
Build a Python class to represent a simple banking system. Create a class for a
BankAccount, and another for Customer. The BankAccount class should have a
constructor to initialize the account details (account number, balance, account type).
The Customer class should have a constructor to set the customer's details (name,
age, address) and create a BankAccount object for each customer. Implement a
destructor for both classes to display a message when objects are destroyed
